= Titleizer

Titleizer is a gem that adds String#titleize (aliased as String#titlecase) to perform smart capitalisation of titles:

  "terms of reference".titleize # => "Terms of Reference"
  "my name is barron von sampy pants and you shall refer to me as such".titleize # => "My Name is Barron Von Sampy Pants and You Shall Refer to Me as Such"

Titleizer also converts underscores and dashes to spaces:

  "a-slug-from-a-url".titleize  # => "A Slug From a Url"

Titleizer also preserves the capitalisation of any word it would capitalise itself:

  "THIS IS A TITLE".titleize  # => THIS is a TITLE"

And lastly, String#titleize is aliased as String#titlecase.

Oh, one last, last thing, there are self-updating versions as well: String#titleize!, and String#titlecase!

== Installation

For plain Ruby, simply install the gem and you're good to go.

For Rails, update environment.rb to include the gem:

  config.gem "harukizaemon-titleizer", :lib => "titleizer", :source => "http://gems.github.com"
